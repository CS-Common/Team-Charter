# Team-Charter

The goal of this assignment is to learn about Git and GitHub as you create a charter for your team. The purpose of the charter is to define what your group's goals, commitments (pun intended), and the milestones along the way. In this charter I want you to identify both the group goals and your individual growth goals.

**Instructions**

1. Make a copy of the Team Charter Template, then
2. Fill in your sections of the Team Charter Template.
3. Save as a new document so that the orginal charter is unchanged. This will help to minimize merge conflicts.
4. Push your version to your repository.

**Markdown Survival Guide**

The  Team Charter Template is formatted using a markup system (language) called [Markdown][]. It uses plain text so that versions of the document can be easily compared, stored in revision control systems, and compared. Take some time to review the [GitHub Guide][markdown].

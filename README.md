# Team-Charter

The goal of this assignment is to learn about Git and GitHub as you create a charter for your team. The purpose of the charter is to define what your group's goals, commitments (pun intended), and the milestones along the way. In the charter you should identify both the group's goals and the individual member's growth goals.

**Instructions**

1. Make a copy of the Team Charter Template, then
2. Fill in your sections of the Team Charter Template.
3. Save as a new document so that the orginal charter is unchanged. This will help to minimize merge conflicts.
4. Push your version to your repository.

**Markdown Survival Guide**

The  Team Charter Template is formatted using a markup system (language) called [Markdown][]. It uses plain text so that versions of the document can be easily compared, stored in revision control systems, and compared. Take some time to review the [GitHub Guide][markdown].
